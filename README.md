# expression-eval

## Solution startegy
* use Scala Parser Combinators [https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators]
* "inspiration" and code snippets from [http://labun.com/fh/ma.pdf]

## Build the project
* the project is an Scala sbt project. 

## Run the console
* simply use `sbt run`

## Testing
* use ScalaTest property-based testing [http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/table_driven_property_checks]. Which unfortunately not as sofisticated as JUnit5 property-based testing solution.
